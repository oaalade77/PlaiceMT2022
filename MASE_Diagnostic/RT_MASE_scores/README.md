### Research Track MASE Scores

This folder contains calculated MASE scores and corresponding plots for research track candidate WHAM assessments of American Plaice. Scripts used to generate these scores and all other MASE scores and plots produced as part of the research track are available [here.](https://github.com/ahart1/PlaiceWG2021/tree/main/WG_Revised_Runs/MASE_Diagnostic)

| **Optional plots that can be generated using calcMASE_plaice.R as of 9/8/22** | |
| "regenerate_...png" | Plots whose names start with "regenerate_" were regenerated by recalculating MASE scores for candidate runs and then then plotting in the calcMASE_plaice.R script |
| "remake_...png" | Plots whose names start with "remake_" were remade using the MASE data files above and the calcMASE_plaice.R script |
